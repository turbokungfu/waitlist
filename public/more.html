independent journalism’ and earned $2.1 million in their first
campaign in 2018 and recently earned $9 million in 2020-21. Larger

closest model to </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Journalocity</span><span style="font-weight: normal">
is </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Post.news</span><span style="font-weight: normal">,
which portrays itself as the ‘Twitter of News’ and has signed up
many large news outlets along with a waiting list of hundreds of
thousands of customers. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">There
seems to be two differences: 1) in interviews, the founder seems to
be targeting Twitter as a competitor. In this sense, he seems to want
to drive the direction of the news away from what he sees as </span><span style="font-weight: normal">a
failing social network. Journalocity does not seek to emulate a
social media model, however, it may one day allow responses to
articles </span><span style="font-weight: normal">in the style of a
‘letter to the editor’</span><span style="font-weight: normal">.
2) Post.news represents ‘premium publishers’, and Journalocity
model will attempt to appeal to small-market and niche journalists
and encourage readers to support their efforts.</span></p>

is a sight called ‘Patch’, which funnels news from the local area

than most local papers. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">It

articles daily. The feed for my area has AP articles, along with

‘Patch Staff’ articles, but they are for the entire Seattle
region and not very compelling.</span></p>

and Substack are also models that allow independent journalists to
write and earn pay. They both use subscription models. Substack
allows users to subscribe to individual journalists and Medium
requires subscriptions to get access to all journalists. Substack
features professional journalists covering a broad range of topics
and charge a monthly fee and </span><span style="font-weight: normal">S</span><span style="font-weight: normal">ubstack
takes a 10% fee and another 3% for the payment administration. Medium
charges a $5 subscription fee for access to all writers. I’ve
written for Medium and a large hurdle is to get enough views to earn
any money. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">Due to this,
journalists are encouraged to write click-bait style articles to
increase engagement.</span></p>

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-weight: normal">	I
believe both of Substack and Medium impose too high a barrier for the
reader and writer for the transaction to occur. Professional writing
can take time, and imposing a subscription model on a writer forces
them to write </span><span style="font-weight: normal">more often
than they otherwise would</span><span style="font-weight: normal">.
</span><span style="font-weight: normal">Journalocity would allow
journalists to focus on a single subject for a length of time set by
their own standard to produce the story they want. If they need a
break, they don’t have subscriber’s expectations to contend with.
With both of these models, the journalist doesn’t get paid until
they either convince people to subscribe, or they reach and maintain
a level of readership deemed worthy by the provider.</span></p>

will still encourage the journalist to participate in marketing
activities, and while click-bait may still wor</span><span style="font-weight: normal">k,
and will take experimenting to ensure the reader gets the best value
for their money. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">The story
profile will allow the journalist an opportunity to let the purchaser
know the effort that went into the production of the article (how
many interviews, hours of editing, etc.) to allow the reader to see
the value of the purchase. There will also be an opportunity for the
reader to tip the journalist beyond the price of the article, which
will go directly to the journalist (minus credit card processing
fees). Further, the journalist can set a buyout price and when that
price is reached, either by cumulative purchases or one large
donation, the article becomes free for all site visitors. </span><span style="font-weight: normal">This
will allow the journalist to meet a substantial financial goal, and
allow readers to directly support articles they value.</span></p>

future version may allow the journalist to opt into an ad-model that
would allow a single banner ad on the article, if the buyout price is

</p>
<p align="left" style="margin-bottom: 0in; line-height: 100%"><span style="font-weight: normal">	This
model does away with the subscription model. While it’s easier to
manage finances with a large subscriber base, my belief is that
readers are tired of organizations asking for subscriptions, and many
people opt out of reading articles because of the requirement to
subscribe. Users could either purchase each article for a fixed price
or fund a wallet that would allow the user to purchase several
articles without incurring a </span><span style="font-weight: normal">fixed
transaction fee. </span>

this model, we hope a journalist could cover a local area, niche
market, or otherwise valuable, but unprofitable subject and earn
enough money to sustain a healthy livelihood. After a certain level
of engagement is made in their area, it would be in Journalocity’s
best interest to assist in the marketing of these articles. For
example, for local news, newspaper-style mailers could be sent out
profiling published and upcoming articles.</span></p>

this model is successful, there could be a revival of local news
outlets. The form may be different than a daily newspaper on the
doorstep, but if local council meetings, sporting events and business
news is covered and the journalists who cover it are well paid, the
mission of Journalocity will have been met.</span></p>
