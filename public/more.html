            <h2>People want to support Journalism</h2>
            <p>When the Guardian added a link to their articles to ‘support independent journalism’ and earned $2.1 million in their first campaign in 2018 and recently earned $9 million in 2020-21. Larger established papers are seeing this as a viable alternative because of their access to large donors and foundations. This type of fundraising may be more difficult for smaller organizations to accomplish.</p>
			<h2>Consolidation has caused a disconnect between journalists and the public they serve.</h2>
            <p>As the internet provided a way to deliver information to broad audiences, it disrupted the traditional methods of revenue for local papers. This produces less local news focused on local issues. Newspapers are either closing or carrying stories not produced locally..</p>
			<h2>Internet ads are killing the newspaper experience</h2>
            <p>The delay page loading, pop over articles, or play videos that interfere with the reader’s experience. In a poll, only 10% of respondents did not find digital ads annoying.</p>

			<h2>Discussion of Current environment</h2>
			<p>The mission of Journalocity is to find a way for journalists to get paid well for their craft. The consolidation of media to a few ‘mainstream’ sources has resulted in cost-saving measures that don’t seem to incentivize more people to enter into journalism as a career.</p>
			<p>Journalocity will experiment with a model that will allow users to purchase articles individually with a substantial portion of the revenue going directly to the journalist. Journalocity would use its portion of the revenue to provide marketing, legal and editorial support for the journalists.</p>
			<p>There are other models with similar ideas and an attempt to differentiate Journalocity from them follows.			</p>
			<p>The closest model to Journalocity is Post.news, which portrays itself as the ‘Twitter of News’ and has signed up many large news outlets along with a waiting list of hundreds of thousands of customers. There seems to be two differences: 1) in interviews, the founder seems to be targeting Twitter as a competitor. In this sense, he seems to want to drive the direction of the news away from what he sees as a failing social network. Journalocity does not seek to emulate a social media model, however, it may one day allow responses to articles in the style of a ‘letter to the editor’. 2) Post.news represents ‘premium publishers’, and Journalocity model will attempt to appeal to small-market and niche journalists and encourage readers to support their efforts.</p>
			<p>There is a sight called ‘Patch’, which funnels news from the local area to readers, but in my experience does not provide a better service than most local papers. It has been operating since 2008, and is still in business. It is an aggregator of news based on location, and then attempts to sell ads based on location. Patch has 135 journalists producing over 1,000 articles daily. The feed for my area has AP articles, along with other sources. There are some ‘community contributors’ and some ‘Patch Staff’ articles, but they are for the entire Seattle region and not very compelling.</p>
			<p>Medium and Substack are also models that allow independent journalists to write and earn pay. They both use subscription models. Substack allows users to subscribe to individual journalists and Medium requires subscriptions to get access to all journalists. Substack features professional journalists covering a broad range of topics and charge a monthly fee and Substack takes a 10% fee and another 3% for the payment administration. Medium charges a $5 subscription fee for access to all writers. I’ve written for Medium and a large hurdle is to get enough views to earn any money. Due to this, journalists are encouraged to write click-bait style articles to increase engagement.

			</p>
			<p>I believe both of Substack and Medium impose too high a barrier for the reader and writer for the transaction to occur. Professional writing can take time, and imposing a subscription model on a writer forces them to write more often than they otherwise would. Journalocity would allow journalists to focus on a single subject for a length of time set by their own standard to produce the story they want. If they need a break, they don’t have subscriber’s expectations to contend with. With both of these models, the journalist doesn’t get paid until they either convince people to subscribe, or they reach and maintain a level of readership deemed worthy by the provider.

			</p>
			<p>Journalocity will still encourage the journalist to participate in marketing activities, and while click-bait may still work, and will take experimenting to ensure the reader gets the best value for their money. The story profile will allow the journalist an opportunity to let the purchaser know the effort that went into the production of the article (how many interviews, hours of editing, etc.) to allow the reader to see the value of the purchase. There will also be an opportunity for the reader to tip the journalist beyond the price of the article, which will go directly to the journalist (minus credit card processing fees). Further, the journalist can set a buyout price and when that price is reached, either by cumulative purchases or one large donation, the article becomes free for all site visitors. This will allow the journalist to meet a substantial financial goal, and allow readers to directly support articles they value.

			</p>
			<p>A future version may allow the journalist to opt into an ad-model that would allow a single banner ad on the article, if the buyout price is met and the journalist approves of the advertiser.

			</p>
			<p>This model does away with the subscription model. While it’s easier to manage finances with a large subscriber base, my belief is that readers are tired of organizations asking for subscriptions, and many people opt out of reading articles because of the requirement to subscribe. Users could either purchase each article for a fixed price or fund a wallet that would allow the user to purchase several articles without incurring a fixed transaction fee.

			</p>
			<p>With this model, we hope a journalist could cover a local area, niche market, or otherwise valuable, but unprofitable subject and earn enough money to sustain a healthy livelihood. After a certain level of engagement is made in their area, it would be in Journalocity’s best interest to assist in the marketing of these articles. For example, for local news, newspaper-style mailers could be sent out profiling published and upcoming articles.

			</p>
			<p>If this model is successful, there could be a revival of local news outlets. The form may be different than a daily newspaper on the doorstep, but if local council meetings, sporting events and business news is covered and the journalists who cover it are well paid, the mission of Journalocity will have been met.</p>
