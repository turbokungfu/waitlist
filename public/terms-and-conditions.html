        <li>
            You agree that you are not a spambot, or robot or other entity trying to disrupt the good nature of the waitlist or Journalocity.
        </li>
        <li>You agree that you will receive at least one email update about the company and understand that Journalocity does not have the capability to automatically remove you from the email list, but will remove you from it manually after receiving a request from your email address.</li>
        <li>You agree that no promises or guarantees will be made by signing up for this waitlist. This is a new venture and there will likely be mistakes and setbacks. I may not even send you a single email or I might send several.</li>
        <li>You will not sign up multiple accounts in an effort to delay or disrupt the Journalocity venture or otherwise try to undermine this venture.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is my intent to provide important, interesting and thoughtful updates, and I understand that the numbers of emails deemed appropriate is subjective. I don’t like sending promotional emails or wasting your time, and I hope you’ll be happy every time you hear from me-so I will try my very best not to abuse your trust in this respect. But please just shoot me an email to remove you if I do get annoying. If  I miss that email request, please forgive me-I promise I don’t want to use your email to sell to anybody or otherwise involve you in some underhanded way. Thank you in advance for trusting me in that regard. </p>
    <p>I did avoid lengthy legalese on this, and I know there is probably some risk in that regard. My hope is that this list will be composed of a small number of people who see the same vision as I do, and as long as I try my best to secure their trust, email and other information, there will be a reasonable understanding of mistakes I might make. I really want this venture to make the world a better place.</p>
